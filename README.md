- <b>MATLAB Signal Processing Coursework (MATLAB)</b>  
  - 📈 Developed digital filters and analyzed audio signals using FFTs and time-domain transformations.  
  - [View on GitHub](#) 
 

- <b>Thermocouple Radiation Error & Heat Transfer Analysis (MATLAB)</b>  
  - 🌡️ Investigated temperature measurement errors in heated airflow using thermocouples of varying size, finish, and emissivity under different air velocities and radiation conditions.  
  - Analysed heat balance equations to calculate convective heat transfer coefficients and emissivity values; validated results using Whitaker’s correlation for spheres.  
  - Produced MATLAB plots showing error trends, airflow effects, and shielding impact, with a final report recommending optimal sensor configurations for minimal measurement error.

- <b>Real-Time Speech Highlighting App (Flutter, Dart)</b>  
  - 🎤 Built a mobile app to support public speaking by highlighting scripted text in real time as it's spoken.  
  - Integrated `speech_to_text` for voice recognition and `highlight_text` for dynamic word tracking; used `Flutter` for UI and responsive interactivity.  
  - Designed to prevent speakers from losing track during presentations by visually updating progress through notes or speeches.
